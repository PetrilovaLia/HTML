    <!-- This element has a cite attribute. The value of the cite 
     attribute is the URL of the source. While this attribute doesn't 
     change the presentation of the block quote, it's very helpful for 
     giving screen readers and search engines more information about the 
     quote. In the browser, you'll see that the text is slightly indented.
    If you want to start and end the block quote with quotation marks, 
    you may need to write them explicitly within the text. You can write 
    the text directly within the block quotation element, like I just did, 
    or wrap it within one or more paragraph elements. This is helpful when 
    the text has multiple paragraphs, but you want to keep them within the 
    same block quote. Here's an example with four paragraphs: -->

    <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
        <p>Build your projects. Show them to your friends. Build projects for your friends.</p>
        <p>Build your network. Help the people you meet along the way. What goes around comes around. You'll get what's coming to you.</p>   
        <p>It is not too late. Life is long.</p>
        <p>You will look back on this moment years from now and be glad you made a move.</p>

    <h2>Adresses</h2>
    How Do You Display Addresses in HTML?

    The contact address element is used to represent contact information for a section on a web page. The address element is versatile and can be used for business pages, author pages, personal sites, and more.

    When it comes to building out your website's contact sections, you should use the semantic address element over a generic element like a div.

    Here is an example of using the address element for a company contact page:

    <address>
    <h2>Company Name</h2>
    <p>
        1234 Elm Street<br />
        Springfield, IL 62701<br />
        United States
    </p>
    <p>Phone: <a href="tel:+15555555555">+1 (555) 555-5555</a></p>
    <p>Email: <a href="mailto:contact@company.com">contact@company.com</a></p>
    </address>

    <h2>Time and date</h2>
    <p>The reservations are for <time datetime="20:00">20:00 </time></p>
    <p>
        The graduation will be on <time datetime="2024-06-15T15:00">June 15</time>
    </p>
    <h2>Math equitation</h2>

    <p>
        Monseigneur is often written as <strong>M<sup>gr</sup></strong>.
    </p>
    <p>CO<sub>2</sub></p>

    <h2>Computer Code</h2>
    <p>
        To set the text color to blue in CSS, use the following code:
        <code>color: blue;</code>
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            body {
            color: red;
            }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2> U, S, and Ruby Elements</h2>
    <p>
        You can use the unarticulated annotation element to highlight
        <u>inccccort</u> <u>spling</u> <u>issses</u>.
    </p>

    <p><s>Tomorrow's hike will be meeting at noon.</s></p>
    <p>Due to unforeseen weather conditions, the hike has been canceled.</p>
